Plant-based diets may be associated with lower circulating levels of \\ninsulin-like growth factor (IGF-1).  They have been found to lead to a 1.23% reduction in \\nHgbA1C, according to one randomized controlled trial (RCT).[5]  \\nVery Low Energy Diets (VLEDs).  A 2020 review and meta-analysis of intermittent and \\ncontinuous VLEDs suggested that this approach to eating is an effective therapy for rapid \\nweight loss and glycemic control, as well as improved lipid metabolism, specifically in \\nT2DM populations that are overweight and obese.  Further research is still required to \\ndetermine long-term benefits or risks of this dietary choice.[6] \\nPlant-Based diets:  A 2018 review of studies related to the implementation of plant-based \\ndiets with people diagnosed with T2DM showed some statistically significant health \\nassociations.  These include improved emotional well-being, physical well-being, \\ndepression, quality of life, general health, hemoglobin A1c levels, weight, and both total and \\nL\\nDL cholesterol.[7] \\nSpecific food and drink choices.  While there is limited high-quality evidence at this time, \\none review of 15 RCTs suggested that there may be a benefit of drinking water or mineral \\nwater as a way of supporting glycemic control.  The data are favorable in animal models at \\nthis point in time.[8]  One of the many areas that is discussed in the literature is the role \\nthat increasing omega-3 or polyunsaturated fats in the diet of people diagnosed with \\ndiabetes.  A 2019 review and meta-analysis of 83 randomized trials concluded that \\nincreasing these types of foods in the diet has little or no effect on the prevention or \\ntreatment of T2DM.[9]  That being said, a 2018 meta-analysis concluded that omega-3 \\npolyunsaturated fatty acids do, in fact, produce favorable hypolipidemic effects, reduce \\nproinflammatory cytokines, and improve hyperglycemia.  Another whole food that has \\nbeen researched with regard to its role in incorporating into a diet is ginger.  \\nA 2019 review \\nand meta-analysis of 8 studies showed that while there was no significant change in fasting \\nblood sugar, there was a statistically significant improvement in hemoglobin A1c in these \\nstudies from baseline to follow-up.[\\n10]  Another 2019 review suggested that blueberry and \\ncr\\nanberry consumption may also have potential positive effects on glycemic control.[11] \\nWEIGHT LOSS \\nWeight loss is recommended for overweight and obese patients with T2DM, independent of \\nthe type of diet a person follows.[12]  Moderate weight loss (5% of body weight) can \\nimp\\nrove insulin action, decrease fasting blood glucose (FBG) concentrations, and reduce \\nthe need for diabetes medications.[13,14]  When weight loss is not achievable, weight \\nmaintenance should be stressed. \\nStudies suggest patients with diabetes and insulin resistance will lose more weight on low \\nGI, high protein diets.[15-18]\\n\\n---\\n\\nSource: data/book2.pdf\\nContent: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus \\nVA Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation \\nPage 5 of 9 \\nPatients with diabetes or at risk of developing diabetes should be encouraged to limit toxin \\nexposure when possible.

Acupuncture to improve glycemic control in diabetes and pre-diabetic \\nstates has been reported in the literature for over half a century, but the evidence is limited \\nand of poor quality.[39,40]  A 2019 review and meta-analysis of 21 studies with a total of \\n1,\\n943 participants suggested that acupuncture could be effectively used as a \\nsupplementary treatment in managing T2DM, especially in people with obesity and \\nmetabolic disorders.  At this point in time, the quality of the evidence is still limited, though \\nit does suggest there may be a reduction in fasting blood glucose, 2-hour blood glucose, and \\nA1c associated with acupuncture plus standard of care treatments.[41] There is some \\neviden\\nce that acupuncture reduces symptoms of diabetic complications (discussed in the \\nnext section). \\nMANAGING DIABETES COMPLICATIONS \\nCARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE \\nIt is widely agreed that diabetes increases a patient’s risk of developing cardiovascular \\ndisease (CVD).  Patients should be counseled that the lifestyle interventions most helpful \\nfor management of diabetes will also reduce their morbidity and mortality from CVD.  This \\nincludes weight loss, increasing physical activity, following a Mediterranean diet, \\nand stress \\nreduction.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSource: data/book1.pdf\\nContent: Urine ketone checks\\nUrine ketone tests are important when your blood sugar is high or when you are ill. Ketones show up in urine when your body is \\nburning fat instead of glucose for fuel because there is too little insulin available. Ketones in the urine is more common in type 1 \\ndiabetes. \\nThis test is easy to do, but to get accurate results, you must follow the directions and be sure that the test strips have not expired. \\nIf you have any questions, be sure to check with your health care provider.\\nHere’s how most urine tests are done:\\n  • Get a sample of your urine in a clean container.\\n  • Place the strip in the sample (you can also pass the strip through the urine stream).\\n  • Gently shake excess urine off the strip. \\n  • Wait for the strip pad to change color. The directions will tell you how long to wait.\\n  • Compare the strip pad to the color chart on the strip bottle. This gives you a range of the amount of ketones in your urine.\\n  • Record your results. \\nWhat do your results mean? A negative result indicates that there are no ketones present. Small amounts of ketones may mean \\nthat ketone buildup is starting; therefore, you should test again in a few hours. Moderate or large amounts of ketones are a  \\ndanger sign because they can upset the chemical balance of your blood and ultimately poison the body. Moderate or large \\namounts of ketones and high blood sugar are indications that your diabetes is out of control. Talk to your health care provider at \\nonce if your urine results show moderate or large amounts of ketones, and never attempt to exercise if there are ketones in your \\nurine.\\nWhen to test\\nAsk your health care provider when to check for ketones, and learn to recognize the warning signs for elevated levels. You may be \\nadvised to check for ketones when\\n  • Your blood sugar is more than 300 mg/dL \\n  • You feel nauseated, are vomiting, or have abdominal pain \\n  • You are sick (for example, with a cold or flu) \\n  • You feel tired all the time \\n  • You are thirsty or have a very dry mouth \\n  • Your skin is flushed \\n  • You have a hard time breathing or your breath smells “fruity” \\n  • You feel confused or “in a fog” \\nThese can be signs of high ketone levels that may require your health care provider’s help.\\nFor more information about diabetes, please visit JourneyForControl.com.\\nCopyright © 2012 Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc.

You may need to check your blood sugar more often if you are  \\n  • Taking insulin or other diabetes medications \\n  • Undergoing intensive insulin therapy  \\n  • Pregnant\\n  • Having a hard time controlling your blood sugar levels\\n  • Having severely low blood sugar levels or ketones from high blood sugar levels\\n  • Having low blood sugar levels without the usual warning signs \\nManaging Your Blood Sugar Levels\\nWhen you have type 2 diabetes, you need to manage your blood sugar carefully to keep it within the target range. Doing so can \\nhelp prevent or delay the onset of complications associated with type 2 diabetes, such as damage to the nerves, eyes, kidneys, \\nand blood vessels.\\nManaging your blood sugar involves balancing the food you eat with exercise and any medications you might be taking. Two \\ntests can help you monitor how well you are managing your blood sugar: a blood sugar check and a urine ketone check.\\nBlood sugar checks\\nBlood sugar checks tell you your blood sugar level at any given time and are the main tool to see how you are doing in managing \\nyour blood sugar. Using a blood glucose meter is the most accurate way to check your blood sugar. It’s important to keep a log \\nof your blood sugar levels so that you can review them with your health care provider. This log will show your body’s response \\nto the foods you are eating and the medications you may be taking. The log will allow your health care provider to modify your \\ntreatment plan as necessary to maintain proper blood sugar control.\\n Here is a chart that includes the ADA’s target blood sugar ranges for many adults with diabetes:\\nGlycemic control  \\nA1C Less than 7%*\\nFasting blood glucose (before a meal) 70–130 mg/dL (5.0–7.2 mmol/L) \\nPostprandial blood glucose (after a meal) Less than 180 mg/dL (less than 10.0 mmol/L)\\nADA=American Diabetes Association.  \\n*The general goal of less than 7% appears reasonable for many adults with diabetes. Less stringent A1C goals may be appropriate for other people, \\nespecially those with a history of low blood sugar.\\n01JourneyForControl.com\\nChoose a State\\nE-mail:\\nWeb site:\\n\\n---\\n\\nSource: data/book2.pdf\\nContent: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus \\nVA Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation \\nPage 7 of 9 \\n• Supplements to Lower Blood Sugar: \\nhttps://www.va.gov/WHOLEHEALTHLIBRARY/tools/supplements-to-lower-blood-\\nsugar.asp \\n• Surroundings: https://www.va.gov/WHOLEHEALTHLIBRARY/self-\\ncare/surroundings.asp \\nAUTHOR(S) \\n“Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus” was written by Jacqueline Redmer, MD, MPH and updated by \\nVincent Minichello, MD (2014, updated 2020). \\nThis Whole Health tool was made possible through a collaborative effort between the \\nUniversity of Wisconsin Integrative Health Program, VA Office of Patient Centered Care and \\nCultural Transformation, and Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation. \\nREFERENCES  \\n1 Hu FB, Manson JE, Stampfer MJ, et al.

This analysis helps to better understand and anticipate patients' behaviour, stress and compliance with their disease and its progression. The Type A personality profile combines hyperactivity, competitiveness and exaggerated ambition, while the B profile is characterized by lower sensitivity to stress and reduced competitiveness.\\n\\nIt has been shown that the type B psychological profile in patients with type 2 diabetes is an independent risk factor for inflammation and that, in type 1 diabetes, the type A psychological profile is associated with a decrease in the expression of the pro-inflammatory cFos gene.\\n\\nThus, the psychological profile appears to have an impact not only on the patient's behaviour but also on his or her biology.\\n\\nIt has never been determined whether the type A or B psychological profile assessed by Bortner's self-administered questionnaire can influence the development of foot wounds in patients with type 2 diabetes who often have a medically unfavourable prognosis and socio-economic difficulties. We would therefore like to study the psychological profile of these individuals in order to make comparisons with the data obtained in a previous study that included patients with type 2 diabetes who did not have a foot wound.\\nStudy Results: NO\\nConditions: Type 2 Diabetes|Foot Wound\\nInterventions: OTHER: questionnaire\\nPrimary Outcome Measures: Score of the Bortner self-questionnaire, Baseline\\nSecondary Outcome Measures: nan\\nOther Outcome Measures: nan\\n\\n\\nStudy Title: Native American Diabetes Project\\nStudy URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05088616\\nStudy Status: TERMINATED\\nBrief Summary: This research study is for American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) people with diabetes in Los Angeles County, California.

ACE-inhibitors or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers are recommended by clinical practice guidelines to lower albuminuria in patients with hypertension and diabetes. However, despite these drugs decrease albuminuria by approximately 30%, elevated albuminuria remains present in the substantial proportion of persons in the general population.\\n\\nSGLT2 inhibitors are a relatively new class of drugs. Originally they were developed as oral antihyperglycemic drugs. SGLT2 inhibitors have been demonstrated to lower albuminuria and protect the kidney in patients with established chronic kidney disease (CKD) with or without diabetes. Whether the efficacy of SGTL2 inhibitors to lower albuminuria (and possibly confer kidney protection) to persons in the general population (with or without diabetes or hypertension) with persistent albuminuria who generally are at early stages of CKD is unknown.\\n\\nObjective:\\n\\nTo assess the albuminuria lowering effects of dapagliflozin in subjects with and without diabetes or hypertension and persistent elevated albuminuria.\\n\\nStudy design:\\n\\nRandomized placebo-controlled double blind clinical trial of 24 weeks in duration followed by a 4 weeks wash-out period\\nStudy Results: NO\\nConditions: Albuminuria\\nInterventions: DRUG: Dapagliflozin 10Mg Tab|DRUG: Placebo\\nPrimary Outcome Measures: urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, Change in albuminuria defined as urinary albumin/creatinine ratio: UACR) with dapagliflozin 10mg/d for 24 weeks relative to placebo, 24 weeks\\nSecondary Outcome Measures: systolic and diastolic blood pressure, Change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure: effect of dapagliflozin 10mg/d compared to placebo on change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 24 weeks|body weight, change in body weight: effect of dapagliflozin 10mg/d compared to placebo on change in body, 24 weeks|HbA1c, change in HbA1c: effect of dapagliflozin 10mg/day compared to placebo on change in HbA1c, 24 weeks|eGFR, change in eGFR: effect of dapagliflozin 10mg/day compared to placebo on change in eGFR, 24 weeks|change in UACR, difference in proportion of patients with ≥30%, 40%, 50% change in UACR from baseline at week 24.: effect of dapagliflozin 10mg/day compared to placebo on the proportion of patients with ≥30%, 40%, 50% change in UACR, 24 weeks|number of SAE's and AE's, Safety of dapagliflozin vs Placebo: number of SAE's and AE's reported by the subject or investigator if qualified as: reason for discontinuation, volume depletion, fracture, diabetic ketoacidosis, amputation and adverse events leading to amputation, urinary tract infection, genital infections and hypoglycemia, 24 weeks\\nOther Outcome Measures: nan\\n\\n\\nStudy Title: Exenatide Pregnancy Registry - Type 2 Diabetes in Pregnancy\\nStudy URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00579150\\nStudy Status: TERMINATED\\nBrief Summary: This is an observational, prospective cohort study describing pregnancy outcomes in women with pre-existing (prior to pregnancy) type 2 diabetes who have been exposed to any formulation of exenatide during pregnancy. The pregnancy registry will compare the occurrence of the pregnancy outcomes of interest with those collected from a prospective group of women with pre-existing type 2 diabetes who have been exposed to one or more antidiabetic medications other than exenatide during pregnancy. Insulin exposures are acceptable in both groups but must be in addition to one or more other antidiabetic medications in the non-exenatide group.\\n\\nThe primary study objective is to evaluate the percentage of major birth defects (i.e., those that caused significant functional or cosmetic impairment, required surgery, or were life-limiting) following use of exenatide during pregnancy for treatment of type 2 diabetes compared to the percentage of major birth defects following use of one or more antidiabetic medications other than exenatide during pregnancy for treatment of type 2 diabetes.\\n\\nThe secondary objectives of the Exenatide Pregnancy Registry are to evaluate the percentage of other adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, preterm birth) and any potential impact of exenatide use during breastfeeding among pregnancies or births in women who used exenatide for pre-existing type 2 diabetes:\"),\n",

Plant-based diets may be associated with lower circulating levels of \\ninsulin-like growth factor (IGF-1).  They have been found to lead to a 1.23% reduction in \\nHgbA1C, according to one randomized controlled trial (RCT).[5]  \\nVery Low Energy Diets (VLEDs).  A 2020 review and meta-analysis of intermittent and \\ncontinuous VLEDs suggested that this approach to eating is an effective therapy for rapid \\nweight loss and glycemic control, as well as improved lipid metabolism, specifically in \\nT2DM populations that are overweight and obese.  Further research is still required to \\ndetermine long-term benefits or risks of this dietary choice.[6] \\nPlant-Based diets:  A 2018 review of studies related to the implementation of plant-based \\ndiets with people diagnosed with T2DM showed some statistically significant health \\nassociations.  These include improved emotional well-being, physical well-being, \\ndepression, quality of life, general health, hemoglobin A1c levels, weight, and both total and \\nL\\nDL cholesterol.[7] \\nSpecific food and drink choices.  While there is limited high-quality evidence at this time, \\none review of 15 RCTs suggested that there may be a benefit of drinking water or mineral \\nwater as a way of supporting glycemic control.  The data are favorable in animal models at \\nthis point in time.[8]  One of the many areas that is discussed in the literature is the role \\nthat increasing omega-3 or polyunsaturated fats in the diet of people diagnosed with \\ndiabetes.  A 2019 review and meta-analysis of 83 randomized trials concluded that \\nincreasing these types of foods in the diet has little or no effect on the prevention or \\ntreatment of T2DM.[9]  That being said, a 2018 meta-analysis concluded that omega-3 \\npolyunsaturated fatty acids do, in fact, produce favorable hypolipidemic effects, reduce \\nproinflammatory cytokines, and improve hyperglycemia.  Another whole food that has \\nbeen researched with regard to its role in incorporating into a diet is ginger.  \\nA 2019 review \\nand meta-analysis of 8 studies showed that while there was no significant change in fasting \\nblood sugar, there was a statistically significant improvement in hemoglobin A1c in these \\nstudies from baseline to follow-up.[\\n10]  Another 2019 review suggested that blueberry and \\ncr\\nanberry consumption may also have potential positive effects on glycemic control.[11] \\nWEIGHT LOSS \\nWeight loss is recommended for overweight and obese patients with T2DM, independent of \\nthe type of diet a person follows.[12]  Moderate weight loss (5% of body weight) can \\nimp\\nrove insulin action, decrease fasting blood glucose (FBG) concentrations, and reduce \\nthe need for diabetes medications.[13,14]  When weight loss is not achievable, weight \\nmaintenance should be stressed. \\nStudies suggest patients with diabetes and insulin resistance will lose more weight on low \\nGI, high protein diets.[15-18]\\n\\n---\\n\\nSource: data/book2.pdf\\nContent: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus \\nVA Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation \\nPage 5 of 9 \\nPatients with diabetes or at risk of developing diabetes should be encouraged to limit toxin \\nexposure when possible.

Acupuncture to improve glycemic control in diabetes and pre-diabetic \\nstates has been reported in the literature for over half a century, but the evidence is limited \\nand of poor quality.[39,40]  A 2019 review and meta-analysis of 21 studies with a total of \\n1,\\n943 participants suggested that acupuncture could be effectively used as a \\nsupplementary treatment in managing T2DM, especially in people with obesity and \\nmetabolic disorders.  At this point in time, the quality of the evidence is still limited, though \\nit does suggest there may be a reduction in fasting blood glucose, 2-hour blood glucose, and \\nA1c associated with acupuncture plus standard of care treatments.[41] There is some \\neviden\\nce that acupuncture reduces symptoms of diabetic complications (discussed in the \\nnext section). \\nMANAGING DIABETES COMPLICATIONS \\nCARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE \\nIt is widely agreed that diabetes increases a patient’s risk of developing cardiovascular \\ndisease (CVD).  Patients should be counseled that the lifestyle interventions most helpful \\nfor management of diabetes will also reduce their morbidity and mortality from CVD.  This \\nincludes weight loss, increasing physical activity, following a Mediterranean diet, \\nand stress \\nreduction.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSource: data/book1.pdf\\nContent: Urine ketone checks\\nUrine ketone tests are important when your blood sugar is high or when you are ill. Ketones show up in urine when your body is \\nburning fat instead of glucose for fuel because there is too little insulin available. Ketones in the urine is more common in type 1 \\ndiabetes. \\nThis test is easy to do, but to get accurate results, you must follow the directions and be sure that the test strips have not expired. \\nIf you have any questions, be sure to check with your health care provider.\\nHere’s how most urine tests are done:\\n  • Get a sample of your urine in a clean container.\\n  • Place the strip in the sample (you can also pass the strip through the urine stream).\\n  • Gently shake excess urine off the strip. \\n  • Wait for the strip pad to change color. The directions will tell you how long to wait.\\n  • Compare the strip pad to the color chart on the strip bottle. This gives you a range of the amount of ketones in your urine.\\n  • Record your results. \\nWhat do your results mean? A negative result indicates that there are no ketones present. Small amounts of ketones may mean \\nthat ketone buildup is starting; therefore, you should test again in a few hours. Moderate or large amounts of ketones are a  \\ndanger sign because they can upset the chemical balance of your blood and ultimately poison the body. Moderate or large \\namounts of ketones and high blood sugar are indications that your diabetes is out of control. Talk to your health care provider at \\nonce if your urine results show moderate or large amounts of ketones, and never attempt to exercise if there are ketones in your \\nurine.\\nWhen to test\\nAsk your health care provider when to check for ketones, and learn to recognize the warning signs for elevated levels. You may be \\nadvised to check for ketones when\\n  • Your blood sugar is more than 300 mg/dL \\n  • You feel nauseated, are vomiting, or have abdominal pain \\n  • You are sick (for example, with a cold or flu) \\n  • You feel tired all the time \\n  • You are thirsty or have a very dry mouth \\n  • Your skin is flushed \\n  • You have a hard time breathing or your breath smells “fruity” \\n  • You feel confused or “in a fog” \\nThese can be signs of high ketone levels that may require your health care provider’s help.\\nFor more information about diabetes, please visit JourneyForControl.com.\\nCopyright © 2012 Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc.

You may need to check your blood sugar more often if you are  \\n  • Taking insulin or other diabetes medications \\n  • Undergoing intensive insulin therapy  \\n  • Pregnant\\n  • Having a hard time controlling your blood sugar levels\\n  • Having severely low blood sugar levels or ketones from high blood sugar levels\\n  • Having low blood sugar levels without the usual warning signs \\nManaging Your Blood Sugar Levels\\nWhen you have type 2 diabetes, you need to manage your blood sugar carefully to keep it within the target range. Doing so can \\nhelp prevent or delay the onset of complications associated with type 2 diabetes, such as damage to the nerves, eyes, kidneys, \\nand blood vessels.\\nManaging your blood sugar involves balancing the food you eat with exercise and any medications you might be taking. Two \\ntests can help you monitor how well you are managing your blood sugar: a blood sugar check and a urine ketone check.\\nBlood sugar checks\\nBlood sugar checks tell you your blood sugar level at any given time and are the main tool to see how you are doing in managing \\nyour blood sugar. Using a blood glucose meter is the most accurate way to check your blood sugar. It’s important to keep a log \\nof your blood sugar levels so that you can review them with your health care provider. This log will show your body’s response \\nto the foods you are eating and the medications you may be taking. The log will allow your health care provider to modify your \\ntreatment plan as necessary to maintain proper blood sugar control.\\n Here is a chart that includes the ADA’s target blood sugar ranges for many adults with diabetes:\\nGlycemic control  \\nA1C Less than 7%*\\nFasting blood glucose (before a meal) 70–130 mg/dL (5.0–7.2 mmol/L) \\nPostprandial blood glucose (after a meal) Less than 180 mg/dL (less than 10.0 mmol/L)\\nADA=American Diabetes Association.  \\n*The general goal of less than 7% appears reasonable for many adults with diabetes. Less stringent A1C goals may be appropriate for other people, \\nespecially those with a history of low blood sugar.\\n01JourneyForControl.com\\nChoose a State\\nE-mail:\\nWeb site:\\n\\n---\\n\\nSource: data/book2.pdf\\nContent: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus \\nVA Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation \\nPage 7 of 9 \\n• Supplements to Lower Blood Sugar: \\nhttps://www.va.gov/WHOLEHEALTHLIBRARY/tools/supplements-to-lower-blood-\\nsugar.asp \\n• Surroundings: https://www.va.gov/WHOLEHEALTHLIBRARY/self-\\ncare/surroundings.asp \\nAUTHOR(S) \\n“Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus” was written by Jacqueline Redmer, MD, MPH and updated by \\nVincent Minichello, MD (2014, updated 2020). \\nThis Whole Health tool was made possible through a collaborative effort between the \\nUniversity of Wisconsin Integrative Health Program, VA Office of Patient Centered Care and \\nCultural Transformation, and Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation. \\nREFERENCES  \\n1 Hu FB, Manson JE, Stampfer MJ, et al.

This analysis helps to better understand and anticipate patients' behaviour, stress and compliance with their disease and its progression. The Type A personality profile combines hyperactivity, competitiveness and exaggerated ambition, while the B profile is characterized by lower sensitivity to stress and reduced competitiveness.\\n\\nIt has been shown that the type B psychological profile in patients with type 2 diabetes is an independent risk factor for inflammation and that, in type 1 diabetes, the type A psychological profile is associated with a decrease in the expression of the pro-inflammatory cFos gene.\\n\\nThus, the psychological profile appears to have an impact not only on the patient's behaviour but also on his or her biology.\\n\\nIt has never been determined whether the type A or B psychological profile assessed by Bortner's self-administered questionnaire can influence the development of foot wounds in patients with type 2 diabetes who often have a medically unfavourable prognosis and socio-economic difficulties. We would therefore like to study the psychological profile of these individuals in order to make comparisons with the data obtained in a previous study that included patients with type 2 diabetes who did not have a foot wound.\\nStudy Results: NO\\nConditions: Type 2 Diabetes|Foot Wound\\nInterventions: OTHER: questionnaire\\nPrimary Outcome Measures: Score of the Bortner self-questionnaire, Baseline\\nSecondary Outcome Measures: nan\\nOther Outcome Measures: nan\\n\\n\\nStudy Title: Native American Diabetes Project\\nStudy URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05088616\\nStudy Status: TERMINATED\\nBrief Summary: This research study is for American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) people with diabetes in Los Angeles County, California.

ACE-inhibitors or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers are recommended by clinical practice guidelines to lower albuminuria in patients with hypertension and diabetes. However, despite these drugs decrease albuminuria by approximately 30%, elevated albuminuria remains present in the substantial proportion of persons in the general population.\\n\\nSGLT2 inhibitors are a relatively new class of drugs. Originally they were developed as oral antihyperglycemic drugs. SGLT2 inhibitors have been demonstrated to lower albuminuria and protect the kidney in patients with established chronic kidney disease (CKD) with or without diabetes. Whether the efficacy of SGTL2 inhibitors to lower albuminuria (and possibly confer kidney protection) to persons in the general population (with or without diabetes or hypertension) with persistent albuminuria who generally are at early stages of CKD is unknown.\\n\\nObjective:\\n\\nTo assess the albuminuria lowering effects of dapagliflozin in subjects with and without diabetes or hypertension and persistent elevated albuminuria.\\n\\nStudy design:\\n\\nRandomized placebo-controlled double blind clinical trial of 24 weeks in duration followed by a 4 weeks wash-out period\\nStudy Results: NO\\nConditions: Albuminuria\\nInterventions: DRUG: Dapagliflozin 10Mg Tab|DRUG: Placebo\\nPrimary Outcome Measures: urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, Change in albuminuria defined as urinary albumin/creatinine ratio: UACR) with dapagliflozin 10mg/d for 24 weeks relative to placebo, 24 weeks\\nSecondary Outcome Measures: systolic and diastolic blood pressure, Change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure: effect of dapagliflozin 10mg/d compared to placebo on change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 24 weeks|body weight, change in body weight: effect of dapagliflozin 10mg/d compared to placebo on change in body, 24 weeks|HbA1c, change in HbA1c: effect of dapagliflozin 10mg/day compared to placebo on change in HbA1c, 24 weeks|eGFR, change in eGFR: effect of dapagliflozin 10mg/day compared to placebo on change in eGFR, 24 weeks|change in UACR, difference in proportion of patients with ≥30%, 40%, 50% change in UACR from baseline at week 24.: effect of dapagliflozin 10mg/day compared to placebo on the proportion of patients with ≥30%, 40%, 50% change in UACR, 24 weeks|number of SAE's and AE's, Safety of dapagliflozin vs Placebo: number of SAE's and AE's reported by the subject or investigator if qualified as: reason for discontinuation, volume depletion, fracture, diabetic ketoacidosis, amputation and adverse events leading to amputation, urinary tract infection, genital infections and hypoglycemia, 24 weeks\\nOther Outcome Measures: nan\\n\\n\\nStudy Title: Exenatide Pregnancy Registry - Type 2 Diabetes in Pregnancy\\nStudy URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00579150\\nStudy Status: TERMINATED\\nBrief Summary: This is an observational, prospective cohort study describing pregnancy outcomes in women with pre-existing (prior to pregnancy) type 2 diabetes who have been exposed to any formulation of exenatide during pregnancy. The pregnancy registry will compare the occurrence of the pregnancy outcomes of interest with those collected from a prospective group of women with pre-existing type 2 diabetes who have been exposed to one or more antidiabetic medications other than exenatide during pregnancy.

Plant-based diets may be associated with lower circulating levels of \\ninsulin-like growth factor (IGF-1).  They have been found to lead to a 1.23% reduction in \\nHgbA1C, according to one randomized controlled trial (RCT).[5]  \\nVery Low Energy Diets (VLEDs).  A 2020 review and meta-analysis of intermittent and \\ncontinuous VLEDs suggested that this approach to eating is an effective therapy for rapid \\nweight loss and glycemic control, as well as improved lipid metabolism, specifically in \\nT2DM populations that are overweight and obese.  Further research is still required to \\ndetermine long-term benefits or risks of this dietary choice.[6] \\nPlant-Based diets:  A 2018 review of studies related to the implementation of plant-based \\ndiets with people diagnosed with T2DM showed some statistically significant health \\nassociations.  These include improved emotional well-being, physical well-being, \\ndepression, quality of life, general health, hemoglobin A1c levels, weight, and both total and \\nL\\nDL cholesterol.[7] \\nSpecific food and drink choices.  While there is limited high-quality evidence at this time, \\none review of 15 RCTs suggested that there may be a benefit of drinking water or mineral \\nwater as a way of supporting glycemic control.  The data are favorable in animal models at \\nthis point in time.[8]  One of the many areas that is discussed in the literature is the role \\nthat increasing omega-3 or polyunsaturated fats in the diet of people diagnosed with \\ndiabetes.  A 2019 review and meta-analysis of 83 randomized trials concluded that \\nincreasing these types of foods in the diet has little or no effect on the prevention or \\ntreatment of T2DM.[9]  That being said, a 2018 meta-analysis concluded that omega-3 \\npolyunsaturated fatty acids do, in fact, produce favorable hypolipidemic effects, reduce \\nproinflammatory cytokines, and improve hyperglycemia.  Another whole food that has \\nbeen researched with regard to its role in incorporating into a diet is ginger.  \\nA 2019 review \\nand meta-analysis of 8 studies showed that while there was no significant change in fasting \\nblood sugar, there was a statistically significant improvement in hemoglobin A1c in these \\nstudies from baseline to follow-up.[\\n10]  Another 2019 review suggested that blueberry and \\ncr\\nanberry consumption may also have potential positive effects on glycemic control.[11] \\nWEIGHT LOSS \\nWeight loss is recommended for overweight and obese patients with T2DM, independent of \\nthe type of diet a person follows.[12]  Moderate weight loss (5% of body weight) can \\nimp\\nrove insulin action, decrease fasting blood glucose (FBG) concentrations, and reduce \\nthe need for diabetes medications.[13,14]  When weight loss is not achievable, weight \\nmaintenance should be stressed. \\nStudies suggest patients with diabetes and insulin resistance will lose more weight on low \\nGI, high protein diets.[15-18]\\n\\n---\\n\\nSource: data/book2.pdf\\nContent: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus \\nVA Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation \\nPage 9 of 9 \\n31 McGinnis RA, McGrady A, Cox SA, Grower-Dowling KA.

Acupuncture to improve glycemic control in diabetes and pre-diabetic \\nstates has been reported in the literature for over half a century, but the evidence is limited \\nand of poor quality.[39,40]  A 2019 review and meta-analysis of 21 studies with a total of \\n1,\\n943 participants suggested that acupuncture could be effectively used as a \\nsupplementary treatment in managing T2DM, especially in people with obesity and \\nmetabolic disorders.  At this point in time, the quality of the evidence is still limited, though \\nit does suggest there may be a reduction in fasting blood glucose, 2-hour blood glucose, and \\nA1c associated with acupuncture plus standard of care treatments.[41] There is some \\neviden\\nce that acupuncture reduces symptoms of diabetic complications (discussed in the \\nnext section). \\nMANAGING DIABETES COMPLICATIONS \\nCARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE \\nIt is widely agreed that diabetes increases a patient’s risk of developing cardiovascular \\ndisease (CVD).  Patients should be counseled that the lifestyle interventions most helpful \\nfor management of diabetes will also reduce their morbidity and mortality from CVD.  This \\nincludes weight loss, increasing physical activity, following a Mediterranean diet, \\nand stress \\nreduction.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSource: data/book2.pdf\\nContent: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus \\nVA Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation \\nPage 7 of 9 \\n• Supplements to Lower Blood Sugar: \\nhttps://www.va.gov/WHOLEHEALTHLIBRARY/tools/supplements-to-lower-blood-\\nsugar.asp \\n• Surroundings: https://www.va.gov/WHOLEHEALTHLIBRARY/self-\\ncare/surroundings.asp \\nAUTHOR(S) \\n“Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus” was written by Jacqueline Redmer, MD, MPH and updated by \\nVincent Minichello, MD (2014, updated 2020). \\nThis Whole Health tool was made possible through a collaborative effort between the \\nUniversity of Wisconsin Integrative Health Program, VA Office of Patient Centered Care and \\nCultural Transformation, and Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation. \\nREFERENCES  \\n1 Hu FB, Manson JE, Stampfer MJ, et al.

You may need to check your blood sugar more often if you are  \\n  • Taking insulin or other diabetes medications \\n  • Undergoing intensive insulin therapy  \\n  • Pregnant\\n  • Having a hard time controlling your blood sugar levels\\n  • Having severely low blood sugar levels or ketones from high blood sugar levels\\n  • Having low blood sugar levels without the usual warning signs \\nManaging Your Blood Sugar Levels\\nWhen you have type 2 diabetes, you need to manage your blood sugar carefully to keep it within the target range. Doing so can \\nhelp prevent or delay the onset of complications associated with type 2 diabetes, such as damage to the nerves, eyes, kidneys, \\nand blood vessels.\\nManaging your blood sugar involves balancing the food you eat with exercise and any medications you might be taking. Two \\ntests can help you monitor how well you are managing your blood sugar: a blood sugar check and a urine ketone check.\\nBlood sugar checks\\nBlood sugar checks tell you your blood sugar level at any given time and are the main tool to see how you are doing in managing \\nyour blood sugar. Using a blood glucose meter is the most accurate way to check your blood sugar. It’s important to keep a log \\nof your blood sugar levels so that you can review them with your health care provider. This log will show your body’s response \\nto the foods you are eating and the medications you may be taking. The log will allow your health care provider to modify your \\ntreatment plan as necessary to maintain proper blood sugar control.\\n Here is a chart that includes the ADA’s target blood sugar ranges for many adults with diabetes:\\nGlycemic control  \\nA1C Less than 7%*\\nFasting blood glucose (before a meal) 70–130 mg/dL (5.0–7.2 mmol/L) \\nPostprandial blood glucose (after a meal) Less than 180 mg/dL (less than 10.0 mmol/L)\\nADA=American Diabetes Association.  \\n*The general goal of less than 7% appears reasonable for many adults with diabetes. Less stringent A1C goals may be appropriate for other people, \\nespecially those with a history of low blood sugar.\\n01JourneyForControl.com\\nChoose a State\\nE-mail:\\nWeb site:\\n\\n---\\n\\nSource: data/book1.pdf\\nContent: Medications can’t cure diabetes. But they can delay or \\nprevent health complications by helping you manage \\nyour blood glucose. Your healthcare provider may also \\nprescribe medications to help control blood pressure \\nand/or cholesterol, which are just as important. Taking \\nmedications every day, especially shots, may seem \\noverwhelming. But they are powerful tools that can \\nhelp manage your diabetes.\\nWhere the Medications Work\\nDiabetes medications for lowering blood glucose act \\non different parts of the body. Some of them \\nincrease insulin release from the pancreas. Others \\nimprove the action of insulin in cells, or keep the \\nliver from releasing too much glucose. And some \\nslow the conversion of carbohydrate to blood sugar.\\nGetting Familiar with Shots\\nSome medications, including insulin, can’t be swallowed. They are usually injected through the skin to \\nreach the bloodstream. It’s not hard to learn how to give yourself shots. And there are new devices for \\ninjecting medications that may be available to you. Ask your healthcare provider for more information.\\nSticking to Your Medication Routine\\nTake your medications as instructed by your healthcare provider. Taking your medications at the right \\ntimes will give you the best control over your blood glucose. Like a meal routine, a medication routine can \\nhelp keep your blood glucose steady. Keep track of medications with a pill organizer and a daily schedule. \\nAsk your family to help you stick to a medication routine. And don’t get distracted. Make it a priority.\\nIf You Take Other Medications\\nSome other medications can affect blood glucose. This includes over-the-counter medications and \\nthose prescribed for other health problems. Make sure you tell your healthcare provider about all the \\nmedications you take, including herbs and vitamins. And always remember to tell the pharmacist that \\nyou have diabetes when buying other medications.\\nYour diabetes educator will help you practice giving \\nyourself shots until you feel comfortable.\\nAdapted from Krames On-Demand HealthSheets created by Krames in collaboration with the American Diabetes Association.  \\nDIAB-1037783-0122 12/12\\n© 2000-2012 The StayWell Company, 780 Township Line Road, Yardley, PA 19067.

Extensive research is \\ncurrently underway to better understand the causes of insulin resistance in the body.  \\nNumerous factors, such as obesity, toxin exposure, infections, and emotional stress all \\ncontribute to chronic inflammation and the development of this chronic condition and its \\nmany negative sequelae.  \\nSeveral large clinical trials have shown that control of hyperglycemia alone does reduce the \\nmicrovascular (small blood vessel) complications of diabetes but it does not definitively \\nreduce the macrovascular (large vessel) complications, such as cardiovascular disease \\n(CVD).  It also does not decrease mortality.  This suggests, then, that only focusing on \\ntreating blood glucose numbers in diabetics is not sufficient.  Additional focus should be \\ngiven to reducing inflammation and improving lifestyle factors, which can have \\nmicrovascular benefits and lengthen lifespan.  This Whole Health tool offers evidence-\\nbased suggestions on how the Whole Health approach can enhance T2DM care. \\nPREVENTION \\nPatients need to know that T2DM is a preventable—and reversible—disease in most cases.  \\nIt is estimated that 90% of diabetes is preventable through changes in diet and exercise, \\nelimination of smoking, and moderation of alcohol intake.[1] \\nSUMMARY OF TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS \\nFOOD AND DRINK \\nLow glycemic index (GI) diet.  The low-GI diet focuses on carbohydrate type.  GI measures \\nhow quickly a carbohydrate affects postprandial glucose levels.  Low GI foods result in a \\nmore gradual rise in glucose and insulin release versus high GI foods.  More insulin release \\nin a short time period can lead to more abrupt drops in glucose levels and promote chronic \\ninflammation.  Over time, the low-GI eating can result in a 0.4% to 0.5% reduction in \\nhemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c).[2,3]  For more information, refer to the “Glycemic Index.” \\nWhole Health tool. \\nMediterranean diet.  The Mediterranean diet is anti-inflammatory and has been found to \\ncounteract the chronic inflammation associated with many chronic diseases.  Patients \\nshould be encouraged to decrease proinflammatory fats and enhance omega-3 intake while \\nreducing the intake of omega-6 fats.  This can result in an 83% reduction in diabetes \\nincidence, with 0.1%-0.6% reduction in HgbA1C.[4]  For more information, refer to “The \\nAnti-Inflammatory Lifestyle” and the “Choosing a Diet” Whole Health tool.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSource: data/book1.pdf\\nContent: Urine ketone checks\\nUrine ketone tests are important when your blood sugar is high or when you are ill. Ketones show up in urine when your body is \\nburning fat instead of glucose for fuel because there is too little insulin available. Ketones in the urine is more common in type 1 \\ndiabetes. \\nThis test is easy to do, but to get accurate results, you must follow the directions and be sure that the test strips have not expired. \\nIf you have any questions, be sure to check with your health care provider.\\nHere’s how most urine tests are done:\\n  • Get a sample of your urine in a clean container.\\n  • Place the strip in the sample (you can also pass the strip through the urine stream).\\n  • Gently shake excess urine off the strip. \\n  • Wait for the strip pad to change color. The directions will tell you how long to wait.\\n  • Compare the strip pad to the color chart on the strip bottle. This gives you a range of the amount of ketones in your urine.\\n  • Record your results. \\nWhat do your results mean? A negative result indicates that there are no ketones present. Small amounts of ketones may mean \\nthat ketone buildup is starting; therefore, you should test again in a few hours. Moderate or large amounts of ketones are a  \\ndanger sign because they can upset the chemical balance of your blood and ultimately poison the body. Moderate or large \\namounts of ketones and high blood sugar are indications that your diabetes is out of control. Talk to your health care provider at \\nonce if your urine results show moderate or large amounts of ketones, and never attempt to exercise if there are ketones in your \\nurine.\\nWhen to test\\nAsk your health care provider when to check for ketones, and learn to recognize the warning signs for elevated levels. You may be \\nadvised to check for ketones when\\n  • Your blood sugar is more than 300 mg/dL \\n  • You feel nauseated, are vomiting, or have abdominal pain \\n  • You are sick (for example, with a cold or flu) \\n  • You feel tired all the time \\n  • You are thirsty or have a very dry mouth \\n  • Your skin is flushed \\n  • You have a hard time breathing or your breath smells “fruity” \\n  • You feel confused or “in a fog” \\nThese can be signs of high ketone levels that may require your health care provider’s help.\\nFor more information about diabetes, please visit JourneyForControl.com.\\nCopyright © 2012 Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc.

A 2018 systematic review of 8 studies on tai chi showed that a tai chi \\npractice of at least 150 minutes per week was associated with lowering hemoglobin A1c on \\naverage by 1.48%.  Fasting blood glucose and body mass index (BMI) were also \\nsignificantly reduced, while quality of life was improved.  This same review also analyzed \\n12 studies on Ba Duan Jin qi gong (Eight Brocades qi gong). This particular qi gong practice \\nwas associated with a decrease in hemoglobin A1c on average by 0.77%, while also \\nimproving fasting blood glucose, BMI, and depression.[27]  Another 2018 meta-analysis \\ncorroborated these benefits of tai chi practice on significantly reducing A1c, and even \\nsuggested that tai chi showed marginally better reduction than other aerobic exercises.[28]  \\nA more extensive 2018 review and meta-analysis of 39 randomized controlled trials (11 tai \\nchi, 6 general qi gong, 22 Eight Brocades qi gong), further supports the conclusion that \\nthese forms of movement significantly lower hemoglobin A1c and fasting blood \\nglucose.[29] Lastly, a 2019 review and meta-analysis showed that tai chi practice in people \\nwith T2DM also significantly reduced blood pressure and improved quality of life.[30]  \\nStructured exercise training programs lead to greater glycemic control than unstructured \\nexercise in diabetic patients \\nPOWER OF THE MIND \\nBiofeedback.  One RCT involving 30 participants found improvement in HgbA1c with \\nbiofeedback techniques Biofeedback can, among other things, produce clinically significant \\ntoe temperature elevations which is associated with increased circulation, improvement of \\nclaudication pain, increased physical activity, more rapid healing of diabetic ulcers, and \\nimproved overall functional status.[32]  \\nMeditation.  Several RCTs show improvement in glucose control with different meditation \\ntechniques.  There is compelling evidence for an association between mental stress and \\nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity.  Increased catecholamine levels \\nreleased by the adrenal glands affect glucose transport and insulin resistance, suggesting a \\nmechanism by which reduced stress levels might improve diabetes control.[33,34]   \\nSURROUNDINGS \\nIt has been suggested that diet and exercise cannot fully explain the current T2DM \\nepidemic throughout the world, and that the prevalence of toxins, including the exponential \\nrise in production and release of organic and inorganic chemicals into the environment \\nduring the last half-century, is a major contributing factor.[35-37]  Refer to Figure 1.'),\n",

Plant-based diets may be associated with lower circulating levels of \\ninsulin-like growth factor (IGF-1).  They have been found to lead to a 1.23% reduction in \\nHgbA1C, according to one randomized controlled trial (RCT).[5]  \\nVery Low Energy Diets (VLEDs).  A 2020 review and meta-analysis of intermittent and \\ncontinuous VLEDs suggested that this approach to eating is an effective therapy for rapid \\nweight loss and glycemic control, as well as improved lipid metabolism, specifically in \\nT2DM populations that are overweight and obese.  Further research is still required to \\ndetermine long-term benefits or risks of this dietary choice.[6] \\nPlant-Based diets:  A 2018 review of studies related to the implementation of plant-based \\ndiets with people diagnosed with T2DM showed some statistically significant health \\nassociations.  These include improved emotional well-being, physical well-being, \\ndepression, quality of life, general health, hemoglobin A1c levels, weight, and both total and \\nL\\nDL cholesterol.[7] \\nSpecific food and drink choices.  While there is limited high-quality evidence at this time, \\none review of 15 RCTs suggested that there may be a benefit of drinking water or mineral \\nwater as a way of supporting glycemic control.  The data are favorable in animal models at \\nthis point in time.[8]  One of the many areas that is discussed in the literature is the role \\nthat increasing omega-3 or polyunsaturated fats in the diet of people diagnosed with \\ndiabetes.  A 2019 review and meta-analysis of 83 randomized trials concluded that \\nincreasing these types of foods in the diet has little or no effect on the prevention or \\ntreatment of T2DM.[9]  That being said, a 2018 meta-analysis concluded that omega-3 \\npolyunsaturated fatty acids do, in fact, produce favorable hypolipidemic effects, reduce \\nproinflammatory cytokines, and improve hyperglycemia.  Another whole food that has \\nbeen researched with regard to its role in incorporating into a diet is ginger.  \\nA 2019 review \\nand meta-analysis of 8 studies showed that while there was no significant change in fasting \\nblood sugar, there was a statistically significant improvement in hemoglobin A1c in these \\nstudies from baseline to follow-up.[\\n10]  Another 2019 review suggested that blueberry and \\ncr\\nanberry consumption may also have potential positive effects on glycemic control.[11] \\nWEIGHT LOSS \\nWeight loss is recommended for overweight and obese patients with T2DM, independent of \\nthe type of diet a person follows.[12]  Moderate weight loss (5% of body weight) can \\nimp\\nrove insulin action, decrease fasting blood glucose (FBG) concentrations, and reduce \\nthe need for diabetes medications.[13,14]  When weight loss is not achievable, weight \\nmaintenance should be stressed. \\nStudies suggest patients with diabetes and insulin resistance will lose more weight on low \\nGI, high protein diets.[15-18]\\n\\n---\\n\\nSource: data/book2.pdf\\nContent: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus \\nVA Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation \\nPage 9 of 9 \\n31 McGinnis RA, McGrady A, Cox SA, Grower-Dowling KA.

Acupuncture to improve glycemic control in diabetes and pre-diabetic \\nstates has been reported in the literature for over half a century, but the evidence is limited \\nand of poor quality.[39,40]  A 2019 review and meta-analysis of 21 studies with a total of \\n1,\\n943 participants suggested that acupuncture could be effectively used as a \\nsupplementary treatment in managing T2DM, especially in people with obesity and \\nmetabolic disorders.  At this point in time, the quality of the evidence is still limited, though \\nit does suggest there may be a reduction in fasting blood glucose, 2-hour blood glucose, and \\nA1c associated with acupuncture plus standard of care treatments.[41] There is some \\neviden\\nce that acupuncture reduces symptoms of diabetic complications (discussed in the \\nnext section). \\nMANAGING DIABETES COMPLICATIONS \\nCARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE \\nIt is widely agreed that diabetes increases a patient’s risk of developing cardiovascular \\ndisease (CVD).  Patients should be counseled that the lifestyle interventions most helpful \\nfor management of diabetes will also reduce their morbidity and mortality from CVD.  This \\nincludes weight loss, increasing physical activity, following a Mediterranean diet, \\nand stress \\nreduction.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSource: data/book2.pdf\\nContent: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus \\nVA Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation \\nPage 7 of 9 \\n• Supplements to Lower Blood Sugar: \\nhttps://www.va.gov/WHOLEHEALTHLIBRARY/tools/supplements-to-lower-blood-\\nsugar.asp \\n• Surroundings: https://www.va.gov/WHOLEHEALTHLIBRARY/self-\\ncare/surroundings.asp \\nAUTHOR(S) \\n“Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus” was written by Jacqueline Redmer, MD, MPH and updated by \\nVincent Minichello, MD (2014, updated 2020). \\nThis Whole Health tool was made possible through a collaborative effort between the \\nUniversity of Wisconsin Integrative Health Program, VA Office of Patient Centered Care and \\nCultural Transformation, and Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation. \\nREFERENCES  \\n1 Hu FB, Manson JE, Stampfer MJ, et al.

You may need to check your blood sugar more often if you are  \\n  • Taking insulin or other diabetes medications \\n  • Undergoing intensive insulin therapy  \\n  • Pregnant\\n  • Having a hard time controlling your blood sugar levels\\n  • Having severely low blood sugar levels or ketones from high blood sugar levels\\n  • Having low blood sugar levels without the usual warning signs \\nManaging Your Blood Sugar Levels\\nWhen you have type 2 diabetes, you need to manage your blood sugar carefully to keep it within the target range. Doing so can \\nhelp prevent or delay the onset of complications associated with type 2 diabetes, such as damage to the nerves, eyes, kidneys, \\nand blood vessels.\\nManaging your blood sugar involves balancing the food you eat with exercise and any medications you might be taking. Two \\ntests can help you monitor how well you are managing your blood sugar: a blood sugar check and a urine ketone check.\\nBlood sugar checks\\nBlood sugar checks tell you your blood sugar level at any given time and are the main tool to see how you are doing in managing \\nyour blood sugar. Using a blood glucose meter is the most accurate way to check your blood sugar. It’s important to keep a log \\nof your blood sugar levels so that you can review them with your health care provider. This log will show your body’s response \\nto the foods you are eating and the medications you may be taking. The log will allow your health care provider to modify your \\ntreatment plan as necessary to maintain proper blood sugar control.\\n Here is a chart that includes the ADA’s target blood sugar ranges for many adults with diabetes:\\nGlycemic control  \\nA1C Less than 7%*\\nFasting blood glucose (before a meal) 70–130 mg/dL (5.0–7.2 mmol/L) \\nPostprandial blood glucose (after a meal) Less than 180 mg/dL (less than 10.0 mmol/L)\\nADA=American Diabetes Association.  \\n*The general goal of less than 7% appears reasonable for many adults with diabetes. Less stringent A1C goals may be appropriate for other people, \\nespecially those with a history of low blood sugar.\\n01JourneyForControl.com\\nChoose a State\\nE-mail:\\nWeb site:\\n\\n---\\n\\nSource: data/book1.pdf\\nContent: Medications can’t cure diabetes. But they can delay or \\nprevent health complications by helping you manage \\nyour blood glucose. Your healthcare provider may also \\nprescribe medications to help control blood pressure \\nand/or cholesterol, which are just as important. Taking \\nmedications every day, especially shots, may seem \\noverwhelming. But they are powerful tools that can \\nhelp manage your diabetes.\\nWhere the Medications Work\\nDiabetes medications for lowering blood glucose act \\non different parts of the body. Some of them \\nincrease insulin release from the pancreas. Others \\nimprove the action of insulin in cells, or keep the \\nliver from releasing too much glucose. And some \\nslow the conversion of carbohydrate to blood sugar.\\nGetting Familiar with Shots\\nSome medications, including insulin, can’t be swallowed. They are usually injected through the skin to \\nreach the bloodstream. It’s not hard to learn how to give yourself shots. And there are new devices for \\ninjecting medications that may be available to you. Ask your healthcare provider for more information.\\nSticking to Your Medication Routine\\nTake your medications as instructed by your healthcare provider. Taking your medications at the right \\ntimes will give you the best control over your blood glucose. Like a meal routine, a medication routine can \\nhelp keep your blood glucose steady. Keep track of medications with a pill organizer and a daily schedule. \\nAsk your family to help you stick to a medication routine. And don’t get distracted. Make it a priority.\\nIf You Take Other Medications\\nSome other medications can affect blood glucose. This includes over-the-counter medications and \\nthose prescribed for other health problems. Make sure you tell your healthcare provider about all the \\nmedications you take, including herbs and vitamins. And always remember to tell the pharmacist that \\nyou have diabetes when buying other medications.\\nYour diabetes educator will help you practice giving \\nyourself shots until you feel comfortable.\\nAdapted from Krames On-Demand HealthSheets created by Krames in collaboration with the American Diabetes Association.  \\nDIAB-1037783-0122 12/12\\n© 2000-2012 The StayWell Company, 780 Township Line Road, Yardley, PA 19067.

Extensive research is \\ncurrently underway to better understand the causes of insulin resistance in the body.  \\nNumerous factors, such as obesity, toxin exposure, infections, and emotional stress all \\ncontribute to chronic inflammation and the development of this chronic condition and its \\nmany negative sequelae.  \\nSeveral large clinical trials have shown that control of hyperglycemia alone does reduce the \\nmicrovascular (small blood vessel) complications of diabetes but it does not definitively \\nreduce the macrovascular (large vessel) complications, such as cardiovascular disease \\n(CVD).  It also does not decrease mortality.  This suggests, then, that only focusing on \\ntreating blood glucose numbers in diabetics is not sufficient.  Additional focus should be \\ngiven to reducing inflammation and improving lifestyle factors, which can have \\nmicrovascular benefits and lengthen lifespan.  This Whole Health tool offers evidence-\\nbased suggestions on how the Whole Health approach can enhance T2DM care. \\nPREVENTION \\nPatients need to know that T2DM is a preventable—and reversible—disease in most cases.  \\nIt is estimated that 90% of diabetes is preventable through changes in diet and exercise, \\nelimination of smoking, and moderation of alcohol intake.[1] \\nSUMMARY OF TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS \\nFOOD AND DRINK \\nLow glycemic index (GI) diet.  The low-GI diet focuses on carbohydrate type.  GI measures \\nhow quickly a carbohydrate affects postprandial glucose levels.  Low GI foods result in a \\nmore gradual rise in glucose and insulin release versus high GI foods.  More insulin release \\nin a short time period can lead to more abrupt drops in glucose levels and promote chronic \\ninflammation.  Over time, the low-GI eating can result in a 0.4% to 0.5% reduction in \\nhemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c).[2,3]  For more information, refer to the “Glycemic Index.” \\nWhole Health tool. \\nMediterranean diet.  The Mediterranean diet is anti-inflammatory and has been found to \\ncounteract the chronic inflammation associated with many chronic diseases.  Patients \\nshould be encouraged to decrease proinflammatory fats and enhance omega-3 intake while \\nreducing the intake of omega-6 fats.  This can result in an 83% reduction in diabetes \\nincidence, with 0.1%-0.6% reduction in HgbA1C.[4]  For more information, refer to “The \\nAnti-Inflammatory Lifestyle” and the “Choosing a Diet” Whole Health tool.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSource: data/book1.pdf\\nContent: Urine ketone checks\\nUrine ketone tests are important when your blood sugar is high or when you are ill. Ketones show up in urine when your body is \\nburning fat instead of glucose for fuel because there is too little insulin available. Ketones in the urine is more common in type 1 \\ndiabetes. \\nThis test is easy to do, but to get accurate results, you must follow the directions and be sure that the test strips have not expired. \\nIf you have any questions, be sure to check with your health care provider.\\nHere’s how most urine tests are done:\\n  • Get a sample of your urine in a clean container.\\n  • Place the strip in the sample (you can also pass the strip through the urine stream).\\n  • Gently shake excess urine off the strip. \\n  • Wait for the strip pad to change color. The directions will tell you how long to wait.\\n  • Compare the strip pad to the color chart on the strip bottle. This gives you a range of the amount of ketones in your urine.\\n  • Record your results. \\nWhat do your results mean? A negative result indicates that there are no ketones present. Small amounts of ketones may mean \\nthat ketone buildup is starting; therefore, you should test again in a few hours. Moderate or large amounts of ketones are a  \\ndanger sign because they can upset the chemical balance of your blood and ultimately poison the body. Moderate or large \\namounts of ketones and high blood sugar are indications that your diabetes is out of control. Talk to your health care provider at \\nonce if your urine results show moderate or large amounts of ketones, and never attempt to exercise if there are ketones in your \\nurine.\\nWhen to test\\nAsk your health care provider when to check for ketones, and learn to recognize the warning signs for elevated levels. You may be \\nadvised to check for ketones when\\n  • Your blood sugar is more than 300 mg/dL \\n  • You feel nauseated, are vomiting, or have abdominal pain \\n  • You are sick (for example, with a cold or flu) \\n  • You feel tired all the time \\n  • You are thirsty or have a very dry mouth \\n  • Your skin is flushed \\n  • You have a hard time breathing or your breath smells “fruity” \\n  • You feel confused or “in a fog” \\nThese can be signs of high ketone levels that may require your health care provider’s help.\\nFor more information about diabetes, please visit JourneyForControl.com.\\nCopyright © 2012 Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc.

A 2018 systematic review of 8 studies on tai chi showed that a tai chi \\npractice of at least 150 minutes per week was associated with lowering hemoglobin A1c on \\naverage by 1.48%.  Fasting blood glucose and body mass index (BMI) were also \\nsignificantly reduced, while quality of life was improved.  This same review also analyzed \\n12 studies on Ba Duan Jin qi gong (Eight Brocades qi gong). This particular qi gong practice \\nwas associated with a decrease in hemoglobin A1c on average by 0.77%, while also \\nimproving fasting blood glucose, BMI, and depression.[27]  Another 2018 meta-analysis \\ncorroborated these benefits of tai chi practice on significantly reducing A1c, and even \\nsuggested that tai chi showed marginally better reduction than other aerobic exercises.[28]  \\nA more extensive 2018 review and meta-analysis of 39 randomized controlled trials (11 tai \\nchi, 6 general qi gong, 22 Eight Brocades qi gong), further supports the conclusion that \\nthese forms of movement significantly lower hemoglobin A1c and fasting blood \\nglucose.[29] Lastly, a 2019 review and meta-analysis showed that tai chi practice in people \\nwith T2DM also significantly reduced blood pressure and improved quality of life.[30]  \\nStructured exercise training programs lead to greater glycemic control than unstructured \\nexercise in diabetic patients \\nPOWER OF THE MIND \\nBiofeedback.  One RCT involving 30 participants found improvement in HgbA1c with \\nbiofeedback techniques Biofeedback can, among other things, produce clinically significant \\ntoe temperature elevations which is associated with increased circulation, improvement of \\nclaudication pain, increased physical activity, more rapid healing of diabetic ulcers, and \\nimproved overall functional status.[32]  \\nMeditation.  Several RCTs show improvement in glucose control with different meditation \\ntechniques.  There is compelling evidence for an association between mental stress and \\nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity.  Increased catecholamine levels \\nreleased by the adrenal glands affect glucose transport and insulin resistance, suggesting a \\nmechanism by which reduced stress levels might improve diabetes control.[33,34]   \\nSURROUNDINGS \\nIt has been suggested that diet and exercise cannot fully explain the current T2DM \\nepidemic throughout the world, and that the prevalence of toxins, including the exponential \\nrise in production and release of organic and inorganic chemicals into the environment \\nduring the last half-century, is a major contributing factor.[35-37]  Refer to Figure 1.'),\n",

Plant-based diets may be associated with lower circulating levels of \\ninsulin-like growth factor (IGF-1).  They have been found to lead to a 1.23% reduction in \\nHgbA1C, according to one randomized controlled trial (RCT).[5]  \\nVery Low Energy Diets (VLEDs).  A 2020 review and meta-analysis of intermittent and \\ncontinuous VLEDs suggested that this approach to eating is an effective therapy for rapid \\nweight loss and glycemic control, as well as improved lipid metabolism, specifically in \\nT2DM populations that are overweight and obese.  Further research is still required to \\ndetermine long-term benefits or risks of this dietary choice.[6] \\nPlant-Based diets:  A 2018 review of studies related to the implementation of plant-based \\ndiets with people diagnosed with T2DM showed some statistically significant health \\nassociations.  These include improved emotional well-being, physical well-being, \\ndepression, quality of life, general health, hemoglobin A1c levels, weight, and both total and \\nL\\nDL cholesterol.[7] \\nSpecific food and drink choices.  While there is limited high-quality evidence at this time, \\none review of 15 RCTs suggested that there may be a benefit of drinking water or mineral \\nwater as a way of supporting glycemic control.  The data are favorable in animal models at \\nthis point in time.[8]  One of the many areas that is discussed in the literature is the role \\nthat increasing omega-3 or polyunsaturated fats in the diet of people diagnosed with \\ndiabetes.  A 2019 review and meta-analysis of 83 randomized trials concluded that \\nincreasing these types of foods in the diet has little or no effect on the prevention or \\ntreatment of T2DM.[9]  That being said, a 2018 meta-analysis concluded that omega-3 \\npolyunsaturated fatty acids do, in fact, produce favorable hypolipidemic effects, reduce \\nproinflammatory cytokines, and improve hyperglycemia.  Another whole food that has \\nbeen researched with regard to its role in incorporating into a diet is ginger.  \\nA 2019 review \\nand meta-analysis of 8 studies showed that while there was no significant change in fasting \\nblood sugar, there was a statistically significant improvement in hemoglobin A1c in these \\nstudies from baseline to follow-up.[\\n10]  Another 2019 review suggested that blueberry and \\ncr\\nanberry consumption may also have potential positive effects on glycemic control.[11] \\nWEIGHT LOSS \\nWeight loss is recommended for overweight and obese patients with T2DM, independent of \\nthe type of diet a person follows.[12]  Moderate weight loss (5% of body weight) can \\nimp\\nrove insulin action, decrease fasting blood glucose (FBG) concentrations, and reduce \\nthe need for diabetes medications.[13,14]  When weight loss is not achievable, weight \\nmaintenance should be stressed. \\nStudies suggest patients with diabetes and insulin resistance will lose more weight on low \\nGI, high protein diets.[15-18]'),\n",

Plant-based diets may be associated with lower circulating levels of \\ninsulin-like growth factor (IGF-1).  They have been found to lead to a 1.23% reduction in \\nHgbA1C, according to one randomized controlled trial (RCT).[5]  \\nVery Low Energy Diets (VLEDs).  A 2020 review and meta-analysis of intermittent and \\ncontinuous VLEDs suggested that this approach to eating is an effective therapy for rapid \\nweight loss and glycemic control, as well as improved lipid metabolism, specifically in \\nT2DM populations that are overweight and obese.  Further research is still required to \\ndetermine long-term benefits or risks of this dietary choice.[6] \\nPlant-Based diets:  A 2018 review of studies related to the implementation of plant-based \\ndiets with people diagnosed with T2DM showed some statistically significant health \\nassociations.  These include improved emotional well-being, physical well-being, \\ndepression, quality of life, general health, hemoglobin A1c levels, weight, and both total and \\nL\\nDL cholesterol.[7] \\nSpecific food and drink choices.  While there is limited high-quality evidence at this time, \\none review of 15 RCTs suggested that there may be a benefit of drinking water or mineral \\nwater as a way of supporting glycemic control.  The data are favorable in animal models at \\nthis point in time.[8]  One of the many areas that is discussed in the literature is the role \\nthat increasing omega-3 or polyunsaturated fats in the diet of people diagnosed with \\ndiabetes.  A 2019 review and meta-analysis of 83 randomized trials concluded that \\nincreasing these types of foods in the diet has little or no effect on the prevention or \\ntreatment of T2DM.[9]  That being said, a 2018 meta-analysis concluded that omega-3 \\npolyunsaturated fatty acids do, in fact, produce favorable hypolipidemic effects, reduce \\nproinflammatory cytokines, and improve hyperglycemia.  Another whole food that has \\nbeen researched with regard to its role in incorporating into a diet is ginger.  \\nA 2019 review \\nand meta-analysis of 8 studies showed that while there was no significant change in fasting \\nblood sugar, there was a statistically significant improvement in hemoglobin A1c in these \\nstudies from baseline to follow-up.[\\n10]  Another 2019 review suggested that blueberry and \\ncr\\nanberry consumption may also have potential positive effects on glycemic control.[11] \\nWEIGHT LOSS \\nWeight loss is recommended for overweight and obese patients with T2DM, independent of \\nthe type of diet a person follows.[12]  Moderate weight loss (5% of body weight) can \\nimp\\nrove insulin action, decrease fasting blood glucose (FBG) concentrations, and reduce \\nthe need for diabetes medications.[13,14]  When weight loss is not achievable, weight \\nmaintenance should be stressed. \\nStudies suggest patients with diabetes and insulin resistance will lose more weight on low \\nGI, high protein diets.[15-18]'),\n",

Ketones show up in urine when your body is \\nburning fat instead of glucose for fuel because there is too little insulin available. Ketones in the urine is more common in type 1 \\ndiabetes. \\nThis test is easy to do, but to get accurate results, you must follow the directions and be sure that the test strips have not expired. \\nIf you have any questions, be sure to check with your health care provider.\\nHere’s how most urine tests are done:\\n  • Get a sample of your urine in a clean container.\\n  • Place the strip in the sample (you can also pass the strip through the urine stream).\\n  • Gently shake excess urine off the strip. \\n  • Wait for the strip pad to change color. The directions will tell you how long to wait.\\n  • Compare the strip pad to the color chart on the strip bottle. This gives you a range of the amount of ketones in your urine.\\n  • Record your results. \\nWhat do your results mean? A negative result indicates that there are no ketones present. Small amounts of ketones may mean \\nthat ketone buildup is starting; therefore, you should test again in a few hours. Moderate or large amounts of ketones are a  \\ndanger sign because they can upset the chemical balance of your blood and ultimately poison the body. Moderate or large \\namounts of ketones and high blood sugar are indications that your diabetes is out of control. Talk to your health care provider at \\nonce if your urine results show moderate or large amounts of ketones, and never attempt to exercise if there are ketones in your \\nurine.\\nWhen to test\\nAsk your health care provider when to check for ketones, and learn to recognize the warning signs for elevated levels. You may be \\nadvised to check for ketones when\\n  • Your blood sugar is more than 300 mg/dL \\n  • You feel nauseated, are vomiting, or have abdominal pain \\n  • You are sick (for example, with a cold or flu) \\n  • You feel tired all the time \\n  • You are thirsty or have a very dry mouth \\n  • Your skin is flushed \\n  • You have a hard time breathing or your breath smells “fruity” \\n  • You feel confused or “in a fog” \\nThese can be signs of high ketone levels that may require your health care provider’s help.\\nFor more information about diabetes, please visit JourneyForControl.com.\\nCopyright © 2012 Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc.

Despite significant progress in understanding how to better manage diabetes, there is oftentimes still uncertainty in the optimal management strategy for a specific patient. As a result, providers and patients must often use a trial-and-error approach to identify an effective treatment regimen.\\n\\nThe project team has previously developed a Diabetes Dashboard that summarizes relevant patient information (e.g., medication history and recent hemoglobin A1c trend). This dashboard allows a clinician to select a target hemoglobin A1c level for the patient in 3 or 6 months, then compare and contrast different options for treatment, including weight loss and the use of different medication regimens. Included in this comparison are known benefits and side effects, as well as the likely chances of achieving the treatment target given the experience of past, similar patients. The Diabetes Dashboard is already available as an optional tab in the EHR system.\\n\\nThe project team has also previously developed the Disease Manager App for evidence-based chronic disease management and health maintenance. The Disease Manger Application is fully integrated with the EHR, and it provides care guidance via individual chronic disease modules as well as a unified module that encompasses all relevant modules for chronic diseases and health maintenance. The initial modules that have been developed are for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and health maintenance.\\n\\nThe objective of this research is to evaluate the Diabetes Dashboard integrated with the Disease Manager App. The Intervention consists of the diabetes module of the Disease Manager App, which incorporates content from the Diabetes Dashboard for pharmacotherapy prediction and provides a link to the Diabetes Dashboard.\\nStudy Results: NO\\nConditions: Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2|Diabetes Mellitus\\nInterventions: OTHER: Diabetes Dashboard integrated with Disease Manager App\\nPrimary Outcome Measures: Change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, Each patient\\'s HbA1c level will be estimated for day 15 of each month, calculated as follows.

This \\nhappens when certain muscles that open and close to allow passage of fluids inside the body don’t work correctly. The semen \\nejaculated into the bladder does no harm and is eliminated during urination. \\nSymptoms of retrograde ejaculation include:\\n  • A small amount of discharge during sex\\n  • Cloudy urine\\n  • Infertility issues\\nRetrograde ejaculation caused by nerve damage due to poor blood sugar control can be treated with medicine. \\nWhat you can do to maintain your sexual health\\nTo have a healthy and fulfilling life with type 2 diabetes and avoid potential sexual complications, it is important to eat right, \\nexercise daily, track your blood sugar, and take medication if needed. \\nFor more information about diabetes, please visit JourneyForControl.com.\\nCopyright © 2012 Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc.

Ketones show up in urine when your body is \\nburning fat instead of glucose for fuel because there is too little insulin available. Ketones in the urine is more common in type 1 \\ndiabetes. \\nThis test is easy to do, but to get accurate results, you must follow the directions and be sure that the test strips have not expired. \\nIf you have any questions, be sure to check with your health care provider.\\nHere’s how most urine tests are done:\\n  • Get a sample of your urine in a clean container.\\n  • Place the strip in the sample (you can also pass the strip through the urine stream).\\n  • Gently shake excess urine off the strip. \\n  • Wait for the strip pad to change color. The directions will tell you how long to wait.\\n  • Compare the strip pad to the color chart on the strip bottle. This gives you a range of the amount of ketones in your urine.\\n  • Record your results. \\nWhat do your results mean? A negative result indicates that there are no ketones present. Small amounts of ketones may mean \\nthat ketone buildup is starting; therefore, you should test again in a few hours. Moderate or large amounts of ketones are a  \\ndanger sign because they can upset the chemical balance of your blood and ultimately poison the body. Moderate or large \\namounts of ketones and high blood sugar are indications that your diabetes is out of control. Talk to your health care provider at \\nonce if your urine results show moderate or large amounts of ketones, and never attempt to exercise if there are ketones in your \\nurine.\\nWhen to test\\nAsk your health care provider when to check for ketones, and learn to recognize the warning signs for elevated levels. You may be \\nadvised to check for ketones when\\n  • Your blood sugar is more than 300 mg/dL \\n  • You feel nauseated, are vomiting, or have abdominal pain \\n  • You are sick (for example, with a cold or flu) \\n  • You feel tired all the time \\n  • You are thirsty or have a very dry mouth \\n  • Your skin is flushed \\n  • You have a hard time breathing or your breath smells “fruity” \\n  • You feel confused or “in a fog” \\nThese can be signs of high ketone levels that may require your health care provider’s help.\\nFor more information about diabetes, please visit JourneyForControl.com.\\nCopyright © 2012 Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc.

Despite significant progress in understanding how to better manage diabetes, there is oftentimes still uncertainty in the optimal management strategy for a specific patient. As a result, providers and patients must often use a trial-and-error approach to identify an effective treatment regimen.\\n\\nThe project team has previously developed a Diabetes Dashboard that summarizes relevant patient information (e.g., medication history and recent hemoglobin A1c trend). This dashboard allows a clinician to select a target hemoglobin A1c level for the patient in 3 or 6 months, then compare and contrast different options for treatment, including weight loss and the use of different medication regimens. Included in this comparison are known benefits and side effects, as well as the likely chances of achieving the treatment target given the experience of past, similar patients. The Diabetes Dashboard is already available as an optional tab in the EHR system.\\n\\nThe project team has also previously developed the Disease Manager App for evidence-based chronic disease management and health maintenance. The Disease Manger Application is fully integrated with the EHR, and it provides care guidance via individual chronic disease modules as well as a unified module that encompasses all relevant modules for chronic diseases and health maintenance. The initial modules that have been developed are for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and health maintenance.\\n\\nThe objective of this research is to evaluate the Diabetes Dashboard integrated with the Disease Manager App. The Intervention consists of the diabetes module of the Disease Manager App, which incorporates content from the Diabetes Dashboard for pharmacotherapy prediction and provides a link to the Diabetes Dashboard.\\nStudy Results: NO\\nConditions: Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2|Diabetes Mellitus\\nInterventions: OTHER: Diabetes Dashboard integrated with Disease Manager App\\nPrimary Outcome Measures: Change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, Each patient\\'s HbA1c level will be estimated for day 15 of each month, calculated as follows.
