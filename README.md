Of course. That's a very practical and important constraint. Loading multi-gigabyte datasets for vectorization can indeed overwhelm a system with limited VRAM.

Let's pivot to an equally robust, portfolio-level use case that is both impressive and manageable with your hardware constraints: an **AI Medical Research Assistant**.

This application will function as a sophisticated tool for medical professionals or students to query a curated set of medical knowledge, combining foundational textbook information, recent research papers, and structured clinical trial data.

### **Use Case and Dataset: AI Medical Research Assistant**

The goal is to build an agent that can answer complex medical questions by synthesizing information from multiple trusted sources. For example, a user could ask, *"What are the latest advancements in treating Type 2 Diabetes, and are there any ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials for new non-insulin medications?"*

**Why this is Portfolio-Ready and VRAM-Friendly:**

*   **High-Impact Domain:** Healthcare and medical research is a serious, high-stakes field. Building a competent tool in this area is highly impressive.
*   **Manageable Data Scope:** Instead of using the entire EDGAR database, we can create a high-quality, focused dataset that is a fraction of the size but still complex enough to require an advanced RAG architecture.
*   **Multi-Source Data:** It still requires combining different types of data (PDFs, abstracts, structured data), which is a key skill to demonstrate.

**Datasets (All Manageable):**

1.  **Medical Research Papers (PubMed Abstracts):** We will not use the entire PubMed database. Instead, we'll download a specific, curated subset. For instance, you can use the Kaggle dataset **"PubMed 200k RCT"**, which contains abstracts from 200,000 randomized controlled trials. This is around 250-300MB, perfectly manageable. We can treat these as our "latest research" source.
2.  **Clinical Trial Data (ClinicalTrials.gov):** This is publicly available, structured data. We can download a CSV or XML snapshot of all studies related to a specific condition (e.g., "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"). This file is also small and provides the structured data component for an agent to query directly.
3.  **Foundational Knowledge (Open-Source Medical Textbook):** We can use 1-2 open-source medical textbooks in PDF format (e.g., from the OpenStax collection or NCBI Bookshelf) to serve as a base layer of knowledge for definitions and fundamental concepts.

### **Roles of Supervisor and Worker Agents**

**Supervisor Agent ("Chief Medical Researcher"):**

This agent acts as the orchestrator. It receives the user's complex query and creates a logical plan of action.

*   **Query Analysis & Planning:** It analyzes the user's question to understand the different pieces of information needed. For the example query, it would identify the need for:
    1.  Information on "latest advancements."
    2.  Information on "Phase 3 clinical trials."
    3.  A filter for "non-insulin medications."
*   **Task Delegation:** It routes these sub-tasks to the appropriate specialist agents. It will first query the foundational textbook for definitions, then the research papers for advancements, and finally the clinical trial data for ongoing studies.
*   **Synthesis & Final Answer Generation:** It collects the outputs from all worker agents, checks for consistency, and synthesizes them into a single, structured, and easy-to-read answer for the end-user.

**Worker Agents (The Research Team):**

*   **`Research_Paper_Agent`:**
    *   **Expertise:** Searching and analyzing the PubMed abstracts dataset.
    *   **Task:** When given a topic like "latest treatments for Type 2 Diabetes," it performs a similarity search on the vectorized abstracts to find the most relevant and recent research papers and summarizes their key findings.

*   **`Clinical_Trial_Agent`:**
    *   **Expertise:** Querying the structured ClinicalTrials.gov data (the CSV file).
    *   **Task:** This agent doesn't need a vector search. It can use a tool like a Pandas DataFrame agent to directly answer structured queries like, "Find all trials where `Condition` is 'Type 2 Diabetes', `Phase` is 'Phase 3', and `Intervention` does not contain 'insulin'."

*   **`Textbook_Agent`:**
    *   **Expertise:** Retrieving foundational knowledge from the PDF medical textbook.
    *   **Task:** Answers basic definitional questions like "What is Type 2 Diabetes?" or "Explain the mechanism of Metformin." This provides the context needed before diving into advanced topics.

### **Complete Project Outline (Updated)**

This outline maintains the portfolio-ready structure while adapting to the new use case.

**1. Foundational Setup**
*   **Environment Setup:** Install LangChain, a transformer library (like `sentence-transformers`), a vector DB (`chromadb`), and Pandas.
*   **Data Ingestion Pipeline:**
    *   Write a script to load the PubMed abstracts, process them (chunking), and store their vector embeddings in ChromaDB.
    *   Write a similar script for the PDF textbook(s).
    *   Load the ClinicalTrials.gov CSV into a Pandas DataFrame that the dedicated agent can access.

**2. Building the Hierarchical Agentic RAG**
*   **Agent Development (using LangChain Tools/Agents):**
    *   **`Textbook_Agent`:** Create a standard retrieval tool over the textbook vector store.
    *   **`Research_Paper_Agent`:** Create a separate retrieval tool over the PubMed vector store.
    *   **`Clinical_Trial_Agent`:** Create a Pandas DataFrame Agent and provide it with the clinical trial DataFrame. Write a clear and concise prompt for it.
*   **Supervisor Agent Development (using LangGraph):**
    *   **Define the Graph State:** The state will track the original question, the sub-tasks, the results from each agent, and the final answer.
    *   **Define the Nodes:** Each agent (Supervisor, Research_Paper, Clinical_Trial, Textbook) will be a node in the graph.
    *   **Define the Edges:** Create the logic (conditional edges) that routes the workflow. For example: `START -> SUPERVISOR -> (decide which worker to call) -> WORKER_AGENT -> SUPERVISOR (to synthesize) -> END`. The supervisor might call multiple workers sequentially or in parallel.

**3. Implementing Guardrails and Advanced Features**
*   **Medical Disclaimer Guardrail:** The very first step in the workflow should be to prepend a disclaimer to the final answer, such as *"This is an AI-generated summary and not medical advice. Consult a qualified healthcare professional."* This is a crucial, responsible feature for a portfolio project in this domain.
*   **Hallucination Check:** Before presenting the final answer, the Supervisor agent can perform a final check by cross-referencing key claims in the synthesized answer against the original source documents retrieved by the worker agents.
*   **Citation and Sourcing:** Modify the agents to not only provide an answer but also cite their sources (e.g., "According to [PubMed ID: 12345]..." or "The Merck Manual states..."). This is a critical feature for any research tool.

**4. Evaluation and Deployment**
*   **Evaluation:** Create a small set of 10-15 complex questions. Run them through both a baseline RAG (using all data in one big index) and your hierarchical agent. Compare the results based on:
    *   **Correctness and Completeness:** Did the agent answer all parts of the question?
    *   **Faithfulness & Citations:** Was the information accurate and properly sourced?
    *   **Clarity:** Was the final answer well-structured?
*   **UI and Deployment:**
    *   Build a clean Streamlit or Gradio interface where a user can type a question.
    *   **Crucial Portfolio Feature:** In the UI, visualize the agent's thought process. Show the plan generated by the supervisor and which worker agent is being called at each step. This makes the complexity and power of your system visible to the user (and recruiters).
    *   Deploy the application using Docker and a cloud service.

This project is not only manageable with your hardware but is also arguably more sophisticated and unique than another financial analysis tool, making your portfolio stand out even more.
